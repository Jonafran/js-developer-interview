# JS Developer (Angular) interview

## Getting Started

This guide gives you a few tips on learning and education. Read the question, google, go to the next, repeat. There are no guarantees that you will receive the same questions in your interview. But I hope that this list will simplify it.

    if (result.length == 0) {
      result = result.concat(str[i])
      continue;
    }
    if (result[result.length-1] != str[i]) {
      if (counter > 1) {
        result = result.concat(counter)
        counter = 1;
      }
      result = result.concat(str[i])
    } else {
      counter++;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

``` javascript
function add(a) {
  function addFunc(b) {
    a += b;
    return addFunc;
  }
  addFunc.valueOf = function() {
    return a;
  }
  return addFunc
}
```

* Create increment function for array (behave like number): ```
  [4,5,3].increment() => [4, 5, 4];
  [4,5,9].increment() => [4, 6, 0]```
``` javascript
Array.prototype.increment = function() { 
  var incremented = false; 
  this.reverse().forEach( (item,i) => { 
    if ( item < 9 && !incremented ) { 
      this[i] = ++item; incremented = true; 
    } else if (item == 9) {
      this[i] = 0;
    }
  });
  if (this[this.length-1] == 0) this.push(1); 
  return this.reverse().slice()  
}
```
